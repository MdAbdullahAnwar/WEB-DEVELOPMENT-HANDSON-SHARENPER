Create an object called Counter with the following functionalities:

It should have:

A starting number called count that begins at 0.
A function called increment that adds 1 to the count and returns the new count right away. This should be a regular function.
A function called incrementWithDelay that waits for a certain amount of time (in milliseconds) before adding 1 to the count and then prints the new count. This function should use an arrow function so that it knows the right context for this.



Note:

The code executes:

Calling increment() twice, which returns the new count each time.
Calling incrementWithDelay(), which prints the new count after some delay.



Example 1:

Input:

increment();
increment();
incrementWithDelay();



Output:

1
2
3



Example 2:

Input:
increment();
incrementWithDelay();



Output:

1
2
