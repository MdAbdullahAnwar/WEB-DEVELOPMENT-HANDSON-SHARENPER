Debugging is one of the important things you should learn.


Trust me, it saves you a hell lot of time to understand why the logical error is coming


Watch the following videos:﻿

1. What is debugging?

2.Debugging in VSCode -Part 1

3.Debugging in VSCode -Part 2



Deliverables:

After watching the videos configure the debugger in the same way explained in the video and complete the following MCQ's.



Ques1. What does debugging primarily involve?

Ans: Finding and fixing errors in code

Answer Explanation

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving bugs or errors in software code to ensure that it behaves as intended.



Ques2. Which of the following is a common type of error that occurs when the code compiles but produces incorrect results?

Ans: Logical error

Answer Explanation

A logical error is a mistake in the logic of the program that causes it to operate incorrectly, even though it compiles successfully.



Ques3. What is a breakpoint?

Ans: A point in the code where execution will pause.

Answer Explanation

A breakpoint is set by the programmer to pause execution at a specific line, allowing for examination of the current state of the application.



Ques4. What does a stack trace provide?

Ans: The sequence of function calls that led to an error

Answer Explanation

A stack trace is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program, which helps in tracing back the sequence of function calls that resulted in an error.



Ques5. What is the primary purpose of using print statements during debugging?

Ans: To display variable values at runtime

Select one answer

Answer Explanation

Print statements are commonly used to output the values of variables and the program's flow at specific points during execution to help diagnose issues.



Ques6. How can you start debugging in VS Code?

Ans: By clicking the green play button in the Debug panel

Answer Explanation

In Visual Studio Code, the green play button in the Debug panel initiates the debugging session for the currently active file.



Ques7. What does the Step Over command do during debugging?

Ans: Step to the next line of code, skipping function calls

Answer Explanation

The Step Over command allows the debugger to execute the current line and move to the next line without stepping into any function calls.



Ques8. What is the purpose of the Watch panel in VS Code during debugging?

Ans: To monitor specific variables or expressions

Answer Explanation

The Watch panel enables users to keep track of specific variables or expressions, allowing them to see how their values change during execution.



Ques9. Which of the following is NOT a feature of the Debug Console in VS Code?

Ans: Running the entire codebase

Answer Explanation

The Debug Console is primarily used for evaluating expressions, viewing output, and inspecting variables, but it does not run the entire codebase.



Ques10. When using the Debug Console, how can you evaluate an expression that involves multiple variables?

Ans: By entering the expression directly(e.g.. var1 + var2) into the Debug Console.

Answer Explanation

The Debug Console allows direct evaluation of expressions involving multiple variables, enabling immediate feedback on their values during debugging sessions



Ques11. Configure the debugger and try using it like the user. Take a screenshot and upload in google drive and put the link here

Ans:
Open project in VS Code.

Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D) → click create launch.json → choose Node.js.

In .vscode/launch.json, set "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js" (replace with your entry file).

Set a breakpoint by clicking left of a line number.

Press F5 (or Run > Start Debugging) → debugger runs, execution pauses at breakpoints.

Use Step Over, Step Into, Watch, Debug Console to inspect variables and flow.
