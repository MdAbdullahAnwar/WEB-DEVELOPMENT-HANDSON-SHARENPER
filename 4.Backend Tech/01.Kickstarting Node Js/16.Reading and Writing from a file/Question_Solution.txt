Complete the MCQ's for Buffer ,streams and req.



Ques1. Understand the use of having buffers and streams? When would you use it?

Ans:
Buffer → Temporary storage for binary data (like images, files, raw bytes). Used when you need the whole data in memory.

Stream → Processes data in small chunks as it arrives. Used for large files or continuous data (video, logs, uploads) to save memory.

When to use:

Use Buffers for small/medium data you can fully load.
Use Streams for large or continuous data to handle it efficiently.



Ques2. Which of the following best describes a stream in Node.js?

Ans: An interface for handling continuous data flow

Answer Explanation

Streams in Node.js allow processing of data as it is being received, enabling efficient handling of large data sets.



Ques3. In Node.js, what does the Buffer class primarily handle?

Ans: Binary data

Answer Explanation

The Buffer class is designed for handling raw binary data, which is essential for I/O operations.



Ques4. Which method in Node.js is used to write data to a file?

Ans: fs.writeFile()

Answer Explanation

The fs.writeFile() method is used to asynchronously write data to a specified file.



Ques5. When working with streams in Node.js, which of these events is emitted when there is no more data to read?

Ans: end

Answer Explanation

The end event indicates that there is no more data to read from the stream.



Ques6. Which HTTP status code indicates "OK" in Node.js?

Ans: 200

Answer Explanation

The status code 200 signifies that the request has succeeded.



Ques7. Which method is used to append data to an existing file in Node.js?

Ans: fs.appendFile()

Answer Explanation

The fs.appendFile() method appends data to a file, creating it if it doesn't exist.



Ques8. In Node.js, which of the following correctly describes the purpose of using the req.on('data', callback) method in an HTTP server?

Ans: To process incoming data chunks in a stream

Answer Explanation

This method listens for data events and processes incoming data as it arrives.



Ques9. What does the HTTP status code 404 represent?

Ans: Not found

Answer Explanation

The 404 status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.



Ques10. What is the purpose of the Buffer.concat() method in Node.js?

Ans: To merge multiple Buffer instances into a single Buffer

Answer Explanation

Buffer.concat() combines several buffers into one, which is useful for efficiently managing binary data.



Ques11. Which of the following options correctly describes a buffer in Node.js?

Ans: A structure that holds binary data for efficient I/O operations

Answer Explanation

Buffers provide a way to work with binary data and facilitate efficient input/output operations in Node.js.



Task 2:

Have a look at this Project Demo link and recreate it.

Project:- DEMO LINK 


I want you to read all the messages from the file and show it at the top of the form.

Everytime you add a new message it should show at the top of the form.

Check for hints if you are stuck with the task for more than 1 hour.


Note: The name of the file should be message and name for the input should be message.
