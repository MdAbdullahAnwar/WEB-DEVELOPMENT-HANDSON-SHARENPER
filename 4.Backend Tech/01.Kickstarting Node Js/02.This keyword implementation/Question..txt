After watching the video complete the following question:

The task is to create a counter object, with some functionalities:


Counter Object


Attribute:

count: A number that starts at 0.


Methods:

increment: A regular function that adds 1 to count and returns the new count.
reset: A regular function that resets count back to 0 and returns the updated count.


Note:

The code executes:

Calling increment() twice, which prints the new count each time.
Calling reset(), which prints 0 after resetting the count.

Example of how regular functions are used:

const Dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  describe: function() {
    return `This is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};

console.log(Dog.describe()); // Output: This is Buddy.
