You have the following object representing the Taj Mahal:


const tajMahal = {

 name: 'Taj Mahal',
 location: 'Agra',
 built: 1648,
 architecturalStyle: 'Mughal',

 dimensions: {
  area: '17 acres',
 },
 UNESCOWorldHeritage: true,
};



Note: Complete this using destructuring



Your task:

Use destructuring to extract the name, location, and dimensions properties from the tajMahal object.

Rename built to yearBuilt during destructuring.

Extract area from the dimensions object and rename them to totalArea respectively.


Create a summary string that includes the monument name, location, year built, building height, building width, and total area in the following format:


"Monument: [name], Location: [location], Year Built: [yearBuilt], Area: [totalArea]"



Example:

Input:

const tajMahal = {

 name: 'Taj Mahal',
 location: 'Agra',
 built: 1648,
 architecturalStyle: 'Mughal',

 dimensions: {
  area: '17 acres',
 },

 UNESCOWorldHeritage: true,

};



Output:

"Monument: Taj Mahal, Location: Agra, Year Built: 1648, Area: 17 acres"
