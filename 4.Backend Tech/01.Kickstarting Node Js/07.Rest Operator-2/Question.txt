We have a function called describe that takes three inputs:

name, age, and a list of hobbies.

The age has a default value of 25, which means if you don’t provide an age, it will use 25 instead.

The rest operator (...hobbies) allows the function to accept any number of hobbies.

Using the arguments we have return a string.



Example 1:

Input

describe('John', 30, 'engineer', 'hiking')


Output

"John is 30 and enjoys engineer, hiking"



Example 2:

Input:

describe('Emma', 28, 'painting', 'cycling')


Output:

"Emma is 28 and enjoys painting, cycling."



Example 3:

Input:

describe('Mike', 22 ,singing)


Output:

"Mike is 22 and enjoys singing."
