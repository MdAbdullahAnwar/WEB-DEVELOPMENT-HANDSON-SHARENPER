After watching the video:

Write a function called combineArrays that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a single array that combines the elements of both arrays.

Note:Use the spread operator to accomplish this.



Example: 1

Input:

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];

const array2 = [4, 5, 6];


Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Example: 2

Input:

const array1= ['apple', 'banana'];

const array2 = ['carrot', 'lettuce'];


Output:

['apple', 'banana', 'carrot', 'lettuce']



Example: 3

Input:

const array1= [10, 'apple', 30];

const array2 = [40];


Output:

[10, 'apple', 30, 40]
