In this task we want to provide our users a facility that allows them to edit their details.



Deliverables:

On clicking of the edit button populate the input fields with details of the corresponding user and make a DELETE request to delete this user.
Now, user can edit the populated input fields. Once he is satisfied with the changes, he will press the submit button. On form submission make a POST request so that these new details are saved for the user. Obviously, the new details of this user should also be displayed on the screen.


NOTE: You would have to make use of user's unique "_id" to perform DELETE operation.

NOTE: If stuck for very long, look at the hint.
