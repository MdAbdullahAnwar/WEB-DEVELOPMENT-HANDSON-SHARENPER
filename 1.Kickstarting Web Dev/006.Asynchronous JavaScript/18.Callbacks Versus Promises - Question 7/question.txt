In this task, your have to create the functions and resolve them sequentially to get the expected output.

Add 3 to the starting number.
Multiply the result by 2.


Functions to Implement
add: Adds 2-second delay, adds 3 to the value, prints “Added 3”, and resolves the promise with the new value.
multiply: Adds 1-second delay, multiplies the value by 2, prints “Multiplied by 2”, and resolves the promise with the new value.


Example:
If the initial value is 2:

After adding 3, it becomes 5.
Then, multiplying 5 by 2 gives 10.


Expected Output:
Added 3

Multiplied by 2

Final result: 10
