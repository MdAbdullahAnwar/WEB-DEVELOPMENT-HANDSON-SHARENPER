You have given three functions which returns the promises , you have to resolve the promises in sequential order to get the expected output

increment: This function should take an integer value, increment it by 1, and pass the new value to the next step.
double: This function should take the incremented value, double it, and pass the result to the next step.
square: This function should take the doubled value, square it, and pass the final result to a logging function.


Expected Output: If the initial value is 2, the output should be: 36

(Explanation: 2 incremented by 1 is 3, 3 doubled is 6, and 6 square is 36.)
