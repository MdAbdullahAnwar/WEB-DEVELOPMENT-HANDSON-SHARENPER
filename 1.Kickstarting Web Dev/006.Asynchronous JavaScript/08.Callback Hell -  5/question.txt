In this question, your task is to create a callback hell and the callback functions. You have to create two functions. Use setTimeout function to add delay. The operations are as follows:

Add 3 to the starting number.
Multiply the result by 2.


Functions to Implement

add: Adds a 2-second delay, adds 3 to the value, prints “Added 3”, and calls the callback with the new value.
multiply: Adds a 1-second delay, multiplies the value by 2,prints “Multiplied by 2“ and calls the callback with the new value.


Example : Initial value is 2, after adding 3 becomes 5, then 5 * 2 is 10



Expected Output
Added 3

Multiplied by 2

Final result : 10
