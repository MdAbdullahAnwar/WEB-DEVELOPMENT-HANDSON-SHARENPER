You have made an application for an education loan. Try to handle this scenario using JavaScript promises.



Deliverable:

Create a function "loanSanctionPromise" that returns a promise which after 3 seconds either resolves with message "Loan sanctioned" or gets rejected with message "Loan not sanctioned".
Make use of Math.random() to mimic both the resolve and reject case.
Handle the fulfillment of the promise with then block and print the resolve message to the console.
Handle the rejection of the promise with catch block and print the reject message to the console.
