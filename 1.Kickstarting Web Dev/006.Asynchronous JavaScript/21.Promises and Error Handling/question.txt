Promises & Error Handling


This Sunday, you have planned to go on a picnic with your family, but you will go only when weather is sunny and not cloudy. Use a promise to simulate this.


Deliverables:

1. Create a function called "checkWeather" that returns a promises which gets resolved or rejected after 3 seconds.

2. If weather is sunny resolve the promise with message "Let us go for picnic".

3. If weather is cloudy reject the promise with error message "Error: It is cloudy".



NOTE: Use Math.random() to simulate the chance of weather being sunny or not.
