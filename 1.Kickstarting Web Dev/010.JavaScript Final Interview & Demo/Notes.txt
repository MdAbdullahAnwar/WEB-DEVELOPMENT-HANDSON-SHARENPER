Deliverable



Your mentor will guide you then as to how to move ahead.
You will be given a rating here. Please be very serious in the demo as bad performance here will affect placements.
Please decide between what you have to move ahead with Frontend or Backend? Do your research. Both of the fields are good and eventually the plan is for you to become full stack developer, but you have to choose one of the paths to begin with.
If you fail in this round mentor will undo the previous assignments and you have again wait for next 7 days.
