You have given array of marks of students .

A topper is a student whose marks are greater than marks of all the students present at its right .

The Student at last of array will always a topper , You have to return Marks of all the toppers in array .



Example 1:

Input:

n = 6

A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}

Output: 17 5 2

Explanation: The first Topper's marks are 17 as it is greater than all the elements to its right. Similarly, the next topper is 5. The right most element is always a topper so it is also included.



Example 2:

Input:

n = 5

A[] = {1,2,3,4,0}

Output: 4 0



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^7

0 <= Ai <= 10^7



Solve this Question in 0(n) Time Complexity.

Hint :- Try to create a right Max array.

Example for Array [1,4,3,1,2]

right Max array is [ 4,4,3,2,2]
