Solve this Question in 0(N) Time complexity.

Hint use Prefix sum.



Example 1:

Input:

N = 4

Arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 3}

Output: True

Explanation: Consider i = 3, for [1, 2] sum is 3 and for [0,3] sum is also 3.



Example 2:

Input:

N = 2

Arr[] = {1, 5}

Output: False

Explanation: No such index present.



Example 3:

Input:

N = 2

Arr[] = {1,2,3,2,1,2, 5}

Output: True

Explanation: Consider i = 4, for [1, 2,3,2] sum is 8 and for [1,2,5] sum is also 8



Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^6
