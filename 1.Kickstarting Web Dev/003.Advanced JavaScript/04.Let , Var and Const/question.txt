A SyntaxError occurs when there is a mistake in the structure or syntax of the code. It happens when JavaScript cannot understand the code because it doesn't follow the correct syntax rules.
console.log('Hello World'; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'

A TypeError occurs when a value is not of the expected type. This often happens when a function or operation is performed on a value of the wrong type.
let person;
console.log(person.name);  // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

A ReferenceError occurs when JavaScript cannot find a variable or function that is referenced. This happens when you try to use a variable or function that has not been declared or is out of scope.
function test() {
    let b = 10;
}
console.log(b);  // ReferenceError: b is not defined
