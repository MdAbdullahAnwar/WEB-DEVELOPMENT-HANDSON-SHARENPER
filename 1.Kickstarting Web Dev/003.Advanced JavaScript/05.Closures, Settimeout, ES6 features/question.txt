QUESTION 3

Write down the 10 new features introduced in ES6 along with what they mean and where they could be used


1. let and const (Block-scoped Variables)
let allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped (only accessible within {}).
const is also block-scoped but cannot be reassigned after initialization.

2. Arrow Functions 
A more concise syntax for writing functions.
It automatically binds this, making it useful in callbacks.

3. Template Literals (Backticks {`   `} )
Allows multi-line strings and string interpolation using ${}.

4. Destructuring Assignment
Extracts values from arrays or objects and assigns them to variables.

5. Spread and Rest Operators (...)
Spread (...) expands an array/object into individual elements.
Rest (...) collects remaining values into an array.

Watch this video to understand it in depth and guess the following output


4a.
var arr = [1, 2,3,5]

var newArr = arr.forEach((item, i ) => {

console.log(item + 'index' + i)

return item + i

})

console.log(newArr)


Output of question 4a
1index0
2index1
3index2
5index3
undefined





4b.
var arr = [1, 2,3,5]

var newArr = arr.map((item, i ) => {

console.log(item + 'index' + i)

return item + i

})

console.log(newArr)

1index0
2index1

What is the main difference between forEach and map function?


forEach: Used to perform an operation (e.g., logging, updating, etc.) on each element of an array. It does not create or return a new array.

map: Used to transform each element of an array and return a new array with the transformed values.
