Given a student object as shown below can you write code to iterate through object and find average age of students.



Input

studentobj = {

'yash': 26,

'vaibhav': 24,

'rajesh' : 25,

}



Output

Average age = 25



Explanation

On adding all the ages we get 75

Total number of keys = 3

So 75/3 = 25.



Can you write a function which takes the object and return average age.



function findaverageage(studentObj){

//write your code here.



return averageAge;

}
