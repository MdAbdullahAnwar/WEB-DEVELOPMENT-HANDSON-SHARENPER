The classroom is consist of N*M rows and columns . Teacher is taking attendance row wise , The present student will be marked by 1 and absent student

will be marked by 0 . You have to find the row in which maximum students are present .



Time Complexity required to solve this Question is 0(n+m).

Hint :- Try to identify a pattern.



Example 1:

Input:

N = 4 ,

M = 4

Arr[][] =

{{0, 1, 1, 1},

{0, 0, 1, 1},

{1, 1, 1, 1},

{0, 0, 0, 0}}

Output: 2

Explanation: Row 3 contains 4 1's



Example 2:

Input:

N = 2,

M = 2

Arr[][] =

{{0, 0},

{1, 1}}

Output: 1

Explanation: Row 1 contains 2 1's (0-based indexing).



Constraints:

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^3

0 ≤ Arr[i][j] ≤ 1
