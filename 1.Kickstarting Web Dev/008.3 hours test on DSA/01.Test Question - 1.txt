An Array of Elements sorted in descending Order is given and an integer Target.

If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1



Example 1:-

Input:-

Arr - [9,5,3, 2,1]

Target - 5



Output:-

1



Explanation:-

Target 5 is present at index 1.



Example 2:-

Input:-

Arr- [10,8,6,4,2,1]

Target - 6



Output:-

2



Explanation:-

Target 6 is present at index 2.



Example 3:-

Input:-

Arr- [10,8,6,4,2,1]

Target - 11



Output:-

-1



Explanation:-

Target 11 is not present therefore we have to return -1.





Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in descending order.
