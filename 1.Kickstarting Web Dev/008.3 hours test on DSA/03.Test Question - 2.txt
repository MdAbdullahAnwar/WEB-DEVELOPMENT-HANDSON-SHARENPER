You are given a array of students id where those who are not single have same id and only one student is single among the array 

where every element appears two times except for one, which appears exactly once.

Find the single element and return it.



Example 1:



Input: nums = [2,2,3]

Output: 3

Example 2:



Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,99]

Output: 99



Solve it in 0(n) time complexity.



Hint:-

Using Maps
Using XOR
