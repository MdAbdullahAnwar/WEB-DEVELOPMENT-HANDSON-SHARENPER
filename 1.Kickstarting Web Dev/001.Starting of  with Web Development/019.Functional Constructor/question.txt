Deliverables



Create a constructor function Person which takes in first name, last name , Sex and age of person
Inside the constructor function , create a function called printFullName which prints full name (first name + last name) of the student
Initialize 2 objects with the following values
"yash", "prasad", 10, "M"
"vaibhav", "prasad", 20, "M"
Minimum age to be egligible for going to disco is 18. Write a function outside the constructor function by which it can be checked whether the given person is allowed to enter the disco or not.


Complete the puzzle. Try it by yourself. It is very easy.

If stuck for more than 1 hour check the hints



Expected Output (case sensitive and space sensitive)

Full name = yash prasad

10

yash not egligible

Full name = vaibhav prasad

20

vaibhav egligible



Small hack to get the correct output



A lot of students get the right output but for some reason it doesnt match the expected output because of case sensitivity or format issues.

A good way to check what is the difference between your output and expected output is through this tool.
