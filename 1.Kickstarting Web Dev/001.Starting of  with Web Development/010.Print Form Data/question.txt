Now, doctor wants you to print to console the patient details.



Deliverables:

Recreate the form you created in the last-to-last task, but this time make sure that all the input elements are having "name" attribute.
When user clicks on the submit button, use an event handler function to print to console the patient details.


NOTE: Do not forget to use the event.preventDefault() method inside the event handler.
