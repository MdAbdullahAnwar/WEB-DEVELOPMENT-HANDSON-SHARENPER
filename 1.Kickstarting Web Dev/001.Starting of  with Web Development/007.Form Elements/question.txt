Now, imagine there is a doctor in your locality who wants to have a website where his potential patients can schedule appointments with him. He hires you to create a registration form for his website. He wants the following details of the patient:

1. Name

2. Email

3. Phone Number

4. Date of appointment

5. Time of appointment



Deliverables:

Use <h1> element with text "Book Appointment" to create a heading for the form.
Now, create a form element with appropriate input elements to collect the details asked by doctor.
Also, add two buttons inside the form - one for submitting the form, and other for resetting the form.

[Note: You should use two <br> tags after each input element.]
