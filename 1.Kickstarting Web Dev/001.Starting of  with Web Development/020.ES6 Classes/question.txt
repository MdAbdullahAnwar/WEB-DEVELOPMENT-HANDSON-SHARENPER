Convert all the features present in the functional contructor of Student into Student class . Best Design pattern to follow


Complete the Puzzle



Create a constructor function Student which takes in first name, last name , roll number and Student's age to initialize the object
Complete the function printFullName() so that it prints the full name of the student object which invokes it.
Complete the function minorOrmajor() so that it
prints major if the student's age is above or equal to 18
prints minor if the student's age is below 18
Make 2 students objects.Ram and Yash to test everything
Yash's details: ('yash', 'prasad', 12, 27)
Ram's details: ('ram', 'prasad', 14, 15)
Invoke prinFullName and minorOrmajor to print Yash's and Ram's details.


If stuck for more than 1 hour check the hints.



Output should look like the following.(Output is case sensitive )

yashprasad

Major

ramprasad

Minor

Small hack to get the correct output


A lot of students get the right output but for some reason it doesnt match the expected output because of case sensitivity or format issues.
