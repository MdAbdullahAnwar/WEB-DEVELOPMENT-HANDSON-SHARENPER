Remember, the form we created in the last task for the doctor in our locality. That form is missing the expected label elements. Why not introduce them?



Deliverables:

Create a label element with text "Patient Details" before the form and link it to the form we created in the last task with the help of some id.
Create label elements for each of the input elements inside the form and use ids to establish association between them.
Create label elements for each of the button elements, but instead of using ids, this time just enclose the buttons inside the label elements to establish association.


Note:

Id and name attribute values for Name input should be “name”
Id and name attribute values for Email input should be “email”
Id and name attribute values for Phone Number input should be “phno”
Id and name attribute values for Date input should be “date”
Id and name attribute values for Time input should be “time”


[Note: You should - i) use one <hr> tag in between the form element and its associated label element, and ii) use two <br> tags after each input element.]
