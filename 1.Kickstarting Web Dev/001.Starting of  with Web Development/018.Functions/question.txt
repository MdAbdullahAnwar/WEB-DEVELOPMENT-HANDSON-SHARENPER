Write a function to take temperature and conversion unit such that it converts the temperature to the respective conversion unit from either Celcius or Kelvin.

Assume temperature is in Celcius if conversion unit is Kelvin.
Assume temperature is in Kelvin if conversion unit is Celcius.


SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT 1

Input

35, K



Output

273+35 = 308



Reason

To convert from Celcius to Kelvin we add 273



SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT 2



Input

308, C



Output

308-273 = 35



Reason

To convert from Kelvin to Celcius we subtract 273
