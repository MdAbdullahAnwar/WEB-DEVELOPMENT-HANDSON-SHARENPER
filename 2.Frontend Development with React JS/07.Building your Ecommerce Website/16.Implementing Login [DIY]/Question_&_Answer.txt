Try Implementing login by yourself. It is quite similar to how signup was implemented.

Follow my steps and try doing it by yourself.



Instead of using signup api url use the login api url as mentioned here - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth#section-sign-in-email-password



Everything remains the same in terms of the request

In the response, when you enter the wrong user credentials - show the user Authentication failed alert like the way you did in signup.

When you put the right credentials you get a idToken which is nothing but the JWT. Console log it in the browser and check.



If stuck for very long watch video 6 from the following link and and understand how things work





One question:-

Once the user has successfully logged In and you get the token as a response. Where would you store the token.

Answer keeping the following things in mind

The token. would be used in all the api calls after logging in so we need to store it smartly, so that it could be used



Ques. Where to Store the Token After Login (Smartly)?

Ans:
After a user logs in and your server sends back an authentication token (e.g. JWT), you should store it in a way that balances accessibility, security, and session management.

Mentioned:
The token must be used in all API calls after login
So it must be easily retrievable by your frontend
But we also need to be smart about storage for security and performance

Smart Storage Strategy:

Store Access Token in Memory or Session Storage


Why? Because:

It's accessible by your frontend (for sending in headers like Authorization: Bearer <token>)

It's not persistent, so if someone gets access to the browser later, it’s not stored forever

It avoids long-term risk from XSS attacks

Use sessionStorage if you want the user to stay logged in only during one tab session

Use memory (e.g., React Context or Redux) if you want even tighter control

Store Refresh Token in HTTP-Only Cookie

The access token expires quickly (as a security best practice), so you’ll need a refresh token to get a new one.

Storing it in an HTTP-only cookie:

Makes it inaccessible to JavaScript (so safe from XSS)

Can be configured with Secure, SameSite, and HttpOnly flags to guard against CSRF



Token Usage Flow After Login:

1. User logs in → server returns access token and refresh token

2. Store access token in memory or sessionStorage

3. Store refresh token in a secure HTTP-only cookie

4. For each API call:
   Read the access token and attach it to the Authorization header

5.If access token expires:
  Use the refresh token to get a new one from the server silently

6.If refresh fails → redirect to login
