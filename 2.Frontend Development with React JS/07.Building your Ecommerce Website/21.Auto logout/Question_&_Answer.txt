Problem

Say if a user logs into his friends laptop and forgets to logout.

This could create a lot of problems. Isn't it.




Deliverable

Create a feature of auto logout.

When a user logs in the token would remain active only for the next 5 minutes.

After 5 minutes if the user refreshes the page he should be told to login again.




Think how will you do this. There are many ways to solve this problem.

If stuck for very long please reach out to the doubt support for mentor's guidance, but definitely try by yourself once.
