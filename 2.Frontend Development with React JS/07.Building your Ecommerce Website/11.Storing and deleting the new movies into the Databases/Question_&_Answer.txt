Problem:

Currently the movie that you are adding doesnt get stored anywhere.

We want to be able to save the list in the database, so that we can retrieve the list whenever we want.


Deliverables

Watch video 9, 10 and 11 from the following link to understand how to make the POST request


Can you add a delete Movie button which takes the id of the movie selected and deletes the movie from the database and also updates the UI , so that the user gets to see that the movie has been deleted
