Problem

One problem with the Ecommerce app is that all the users can see the products page without even loggin In.

We need to redirect users who are not logged in to the Login Page



Research

Watch video 275 and 276 and understand how does redirect work



Deliverable



Lets make login mandatory so that only users who are logged In can see the products

Users who have not logged In should not be allowed to check the products

Whenever the user who has not logged In clicks on the Products tab should be redirected to Login Page automatically.
