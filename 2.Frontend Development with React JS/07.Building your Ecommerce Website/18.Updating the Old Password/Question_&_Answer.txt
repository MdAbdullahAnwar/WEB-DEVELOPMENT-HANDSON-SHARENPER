Problem:

When the user logs in and want to change his current password . He can use your product for changing the password.




Deliverable [Do it yourself]


When the user is successfully logged In show him the page like this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cza0_sbqMmZ9Beq_pUPpERwH1FQVyVQw/view?usp=sharing.

When the user types the new password, submit the POST request to the url as mentioned here - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth#section-change-password

The above url take 3 things in the payload --> idToken, newPassword, returnSecureToken(this is always true)

Now try logging in with the old token and it should throw an alert.


if stuck for very long watch video 8 and 9 from the following link.
