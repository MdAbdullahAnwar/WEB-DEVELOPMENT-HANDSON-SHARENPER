Deliverable

Make a cart Component with hard coded products.[ Currently you dont have to build the Add to Cart functionality - We would do that in next task]


Take a hardcoded array like this and show all the elements in the cart

const cartElements = [

{

title: 'Colors',

price: 100,

imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%201.png',

quantity: 2,

},

{

title: 'Black and white Colors',

price: 50,

imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%202.png',

quantity: 3,

},

{

title: 'Yellow and Black Colors',

price: 70,

imageUrl: 'https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/img/Album%203.png',

quantity: 1,

}

]


3. When the user clicks on the cart icon at the top right , open the cart and show all the carts saved in the hardcoded cartElements array.

4. Now add a remove button next to the cart Elements , so that the user can remove the elements from the cart.


The cart should work like this https://prasadyash2411.github.io/ecom-website/dynamicstore.html

Things pending to integrate [Will do in the next tasks, don't have to do in this task]


Add to cart next to the product should work . [Will use Context Api here]


About and home page need to be built
