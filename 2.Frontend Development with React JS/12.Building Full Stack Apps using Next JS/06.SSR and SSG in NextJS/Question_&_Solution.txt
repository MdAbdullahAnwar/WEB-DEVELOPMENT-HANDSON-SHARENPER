Introduction to SSR and SSG in Next.js (App Router)

In this task, you’ll learn the core concepts of SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation) using the App Router in Next.js 13+.



▶️ Instructions



Watch the video following video: SSR and SSG


Pay close attention to:

The difference between server-side rendering and static rendering

How async server components work for data fetching

When data is fetched on the server and when pages are pre-rendered at build time

How fetch() is automatically cached or revalidated



💡 Key Concept

In the App Router:



Static Rendering (SSG) happens when a component fetches data at build time (default with fetch()).

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) happens when you disable caching or use dynamic functions like fetch(..., { cache: "no-store" }).

A short quiz on SSR vs SSG in the App Router



Ques1. In the App Router, what happens when you fetch data using fetch() in a server component without any options?

Ans: It fetches data during build time and caches it.



Ques2. What makes a page server-side rendered in the App Router?

Ans: Disabling fetch cache with {cache: "no-store"}



Ques3. Which of the following is TRUE about data fetching in App Router?

Ans: Fetching data inside server components happens on the server by default.



Ques4. What is the default rendering strategy when using fetch() in a server component?

Ans: Static rendering with full caching



Ques5. Which of the following will trigger Server-Side Rendering (no cache)?

Ans: fetch(url, { cache: "no-store" })
