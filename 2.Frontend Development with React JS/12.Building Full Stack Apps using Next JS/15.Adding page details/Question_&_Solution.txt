Add Metadata (Static & Dynamic)




Deliverables:





Add static metadata to the homepage with the title:



"Products Store - Home".



Add static metadata to the product listing page with the title:



"Products Store - Products List".



Add dynamic metadata to the product detail page so that the page title reflects the product’s name fetched from the API e.g: e.g., "Wireless Headphones - Products Store" for one product, and "Smartwatch - Products Store" for another.



Ensure the metadata updates correctly when navigating between different product detail pages.







Please submit your GitHub commit link after you have created the metadata.
