Add Basic Login and Protect Pages




Deliverables:





Create a login page (/app/login/page.js) with a simple form (hardcoded username/password).



Show a Login button in the header when the user is logged out; clicking it goes to the login page.



Protect the products pages (/app/products and /app/products/[id]) so only logged-in users can access them.



If not logged in, redirect users to the login page.



After login, redirect back to the products page.



When logged in, show a Logout button in the header that logs the user out and redirects to login.




Please submit your GitHub commit link after you have created the login functionality.
