Let's revise basic routing:




Deliverable:

Task 1: Basic Routing





Create /app/page.js that displays the welcome message:



Welcome to the Products Store



Create /app/products/page.js that displays a simple placeholder text indicating the products page and includes links to product pages for product IDs 1 through 10.




Task 2: Dynamic Route Placeholder





Create /app/products/[id]/page.js that displays a framed static message:



Product [id] details page — content coming soon!



where [id] is dynamic and reflects the product ID in the URL.




Please submit your GitHub commit link after you have created the routes.
