Let's revise layouts



Deliverables:

Create a global layout file at /app/layout.js that wraps all pages in the app.

Include a header section with static text (e.g., a site title or navigation placeholder).

Include a footer section with static text (e.g., copyright or site info).

Ensure the layout properly renders the page content between the header and footer.




Please submit your GitHub commit link after you have created the layout.
