Data Fetching with Caching & Navigation

We're not creating our own backend at this stage. However, you can integrate one later if needed. For now, we are using a predefined dataset from https://dummyjson.com to simulate backend responses.




Task 1:





Update /app/products/page.js to fetch product data from:



https://dummyjson.com/products



Go through the documentation for next and make yourself familiar with revalidate. and enable caching with:





fetch('https://dummyjson.com/products')

Task 2:





Update /app/products/[id]/page.js to dynamically fetch and display individual product details based on the product ID in the URL.



Add navigation links in the layout header to:





Home (/)



Products (/products)




Please submit your GitHub commit link after you have created the layout.
