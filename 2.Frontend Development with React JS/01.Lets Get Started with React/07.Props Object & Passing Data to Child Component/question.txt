Deliverable:

1. Create a <div>, after the date <div>, for location of the expense.

2. To this <div> apply a class called "expense-item__location".

3. In App.js give each ExpenseItem component an extra attribute called location and pass:

Bangalore as its value for ExpenseItem with title Insurance
Delhi as its value for ExpenseItem with title Book
Hyderabad as its value for ExpenseItem with title Pen
Mumbai as its value for ExpenseItem with title Laptop
4. Display these locations on screen for the corresponding expense item inside the location <div> that you created inside the ExpenseItem component. [Hint: Make use of props object.]
