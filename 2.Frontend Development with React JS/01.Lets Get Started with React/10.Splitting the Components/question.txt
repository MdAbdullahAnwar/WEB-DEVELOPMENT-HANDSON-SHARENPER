Go through the following video:

Splitting The Components



Deliverables:

Split the ExpenseItem component into ExpenseDate component just the way I have done in the video.
Try to split the App component into a component named Expenses as I explained it in the video.
Import and use the Expenses.css file in the Expenses component.


Note: If stuck for long, check hints.
