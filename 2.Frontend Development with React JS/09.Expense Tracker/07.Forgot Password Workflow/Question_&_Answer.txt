Problem



Once the user has logged Out , there is a very high chance that he might forget the password.



What do we do now




Solution

Add a forgot password button so that when the user clicks on it https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0HWepSUWoY7a7akbtPti07ZbqdPiRhr/view?usp=sharing, it should open a page like this

Once the user enters the mail id call the firebase API and show a loader on the screen uptill the response doesnt come from firebase api. Follow this doc

You would recieve a password reset link in your mail id which you entered above.

Open the link and change the password.

Now try logging into your website via the new password and it should work
