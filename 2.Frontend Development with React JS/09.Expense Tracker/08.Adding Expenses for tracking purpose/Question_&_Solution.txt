Add the feature of adding the "daily expenses" on the website.


Deliverable:


1. Make the frontend for the user for entering the following in a form having 3 input elements

the money he had spent

the description of the expense done.

the category.(This should be a dropdown) (e.g. Food, Petrol, salary etc.)


2. Make this frontend visible only after successful login.

3. Show the expenses that the user has added , below the form itself.

4. You dont have to integrate it with backend as a part of this task. In the next task you will see how to do it.
