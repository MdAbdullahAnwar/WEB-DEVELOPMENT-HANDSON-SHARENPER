Problem with the current app




When the user has updated his profile and if he refreshes the page , the data saved in profile page is lost. It again shows incomplete


The data is saved in the database of firebase


You just have to make a GET request to firebase api with the idToken, refer to this doc


Whatever data you get pre-fill the input form with that data show that the user can see his previously entered values and edit that if needed




Push the code to git and upload the commit ID
