Watch video 1 and 2 from the following link and understand the problem statement we are about to solve




Watch the first 2 min of the video 3, understand what set of features the trainer is asking for and try doing it yourself.

Don't watch the entire video. Try it by yourself. It is super simple




Deliverables





First install all the dependencies for using reducer--> react-redux and redux toolkit



When we click on mycart button, the cart should become visible. If we click on it again it should become invisible again. (cartreducer)







If stuck for more than 1 hour watch the video 3.




Once done,Push the code to git and upload the commit ID.

Also write whether you did the code by yourself or not. Be honest!!!!
