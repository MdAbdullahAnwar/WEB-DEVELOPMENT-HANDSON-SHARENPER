What is a Custom Hook?
In React, a custom hook is a reusable function that encapsulates logic used in multiple components. It allows us to extract common functionality, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.



Imagine you're working on an application where multiple components need to fetch data from an API.
Instead of writing the same fetching logic in each component, you can create a custom hook (useFetch) that handles API requests, loading states, and errors.
This way, all components can simply use useFetch without repeating the logic.
