Deliverable [TRY DOING THIS BY YOURSELF]

Try building the header like this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hLhqdtPLFsrw20m4MJl3GQpdZyyq_q/view?usp=sharing .Its fine if it doesn't look exactly like the image .
The cart button can for the time being show 0 cart items. You don't have to write the logic for counting elements in the cart. We can do that later


Its important that you try doing this by yourself. Its ok if you don't follow the best design patterns and file structure.


If stuck for very long watch video 3 and 4 from the above link.


Once done, push the code to git and upload the commit id
