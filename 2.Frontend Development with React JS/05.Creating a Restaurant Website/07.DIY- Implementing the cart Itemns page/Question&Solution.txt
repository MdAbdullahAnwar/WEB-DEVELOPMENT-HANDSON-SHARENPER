So the items of the carts are used in multiple components in the website

In showing the number of cart Items next to the carticon https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TchLhjm_Ubj5Co5bKXVzLQXUaTqyfaW/view?usp=sharing
When the cart opens, cart Items are shown


A good design pattern to use is Context API so that the cart is accessible to all the components.

Watch video 12 and 13  from the following link to understand how it can be implemented



Deliverable

1. Tell me how does the reduce work
2. Without watching videos after 13 , can you try to make the cart Items work. Whenever the user adds an item in his order , the cart Item should get update. [ Hint- You just need to play with Context Api]
It is super simple .Dont watch videos after 13, the udemy trainer does very stupid and writes complicated stuff, which he also has no clue about XD.

3. If stuck for long watch this playlist to understand how does context APi and states work in react . 

The last video also has the next set of task which you need to implement. Finish that by yourself!!!
