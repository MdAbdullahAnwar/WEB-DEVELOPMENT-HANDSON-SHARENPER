Problem

The user is not able to distinguish between mails that he has read and mails that he has not read

The user is not able to see the complete message in the inbox view.

The user doesn't even get to see the total number of unread message.




Solution

1. When the user gets a new message , it should have a blue dot before the message like this

2. When the user clicks on the message he should be able to read the entire message like this

3. When the user has read the message by clicking on it , the blue dot should no loner be visible , like this.

4. When I refresh the page too, I should not see blue dots for read messages , so update it in backend[If you know node JS - Make an api which marks the message as read: true in db or else update the same in firebase.]

The total number of unread message should be visible on the left for the user to know, like this




Hints

You have to use reducers for storing all the details that you get from the api
