Problem

When a user has recieved a mail from other user, uptill the user doesnt refresh the page -> he will not be able to see the new mail
This is a big problem


Deliverable

Keep calling the backend api every 2 seconds from the frontend and get the list of mails.
If there are any new mail rerender the UI in the most optimised way and show the list.
Make sure the unread mail count increases too on the left side too.
