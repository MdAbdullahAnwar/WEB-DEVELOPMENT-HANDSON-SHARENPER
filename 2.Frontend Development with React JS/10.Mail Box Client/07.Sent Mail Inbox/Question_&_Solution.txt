Problem

The user cannot see the mails which he has sent to other users.

This is a big problem




Deliverable





When the user clicks on the sent button on the left , open the sent box (Like this)



Call the backend api (Node Js api or firebase) and get all the mails that have been sent by the users. (Reuse the inbox component which you made before)



He should be able to read the mails like before (Reuse the Read Mail component you built previously)




Push the code to git and upload the commit ID
