Problem

You have been sending mails.

But how will the other user who is receiving it view it?




Solution

Build a page like this where user can see all the mails that has been sent to him.

[If you know Node JS - build your own api or else use firebases]





Make a GET request and get all the mails that have been sent to the user.



When the user clicks on compose button , open the editor for composing and sending mails which you created in previous task.




Push the code to git and upload the commit ID.
