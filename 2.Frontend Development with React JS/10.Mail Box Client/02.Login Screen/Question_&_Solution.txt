Deliverable

Once the user is successfully created , he should be able to login going forward

Create the login screen like this - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrrnlwyWW9gX6uD-gAYx06b7-bBfkz2L/view?usp=sharing

[If you know NodeJS] - Design your own backend login api.

[If you dont know NodeJS] - Use firebase email auth just like before. Refer this for the docs . Try doing it completely by yourself.

When the user enters wrong credentials , alert him like before

When the user has entered the right credentials store the token that you get from firebase like before

On successful login show him a dummy screen where it is written "Welcome to your mail box" like this - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdCrRR1EyafdyhftKSlX0Cvlh8hnqtTR/view?usp=sharing
