You have given a sorted array of how much sharpenerians is placed by sharpener in a month ,the number of sharpenerians placed can be duplicates

You are given a number X which is the number of sharpenerians placed , it can have many duplicate X elements

You have to Find the index of first and last occurance of X .



Solve it in LOG(N) Time Complexity



Example 1:

Input:

n=9, x=5

arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }

Output: 2 5

Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5.



Example 2:

Input:

n=9, x=7

arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125 }

Output: 6 6

Explanation: First occurrence of 7 is at index 6 and last occurrence of 7 is also at index 6.
