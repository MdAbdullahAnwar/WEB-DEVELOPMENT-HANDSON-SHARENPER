Ques1. How to iterate inside and object and print all the values inside it without the keys? Give a code example?

Ans:
const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  city: "New York"
};

Object.values(obj).forEach(value => {
  console.log(value);
});



Ques2. What is the NaN property in JavaScript?

Ans: The NaN property represents a value that is "Not a Number" and is returned when a mathematical operation fails.



Ques3. Explain pass by value and pass by reference? Give code example of how you would pass by reference in javascript?

Ans: 
Pass by Value: For primitive types (string, number, boolean), the value is copied.

let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10
Pass by Reference: For non-primitives (objects, arrays), the reference is passed.


const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1.name); // "Bob" (same reference)



Ques4. What does the "this" keyword represent in JavaScript?

Ans: The current execution context or the object that owns the currently executing code.



Ques5. What is memoization in javascript? Can you give a code example implementing the same?

Ans:
Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

function memoizedAdd() {
  let cache = {};
  return function(n) {
    if (cache[n]) {
      console.log("Returning from cache");
      return cache[n];
    }
    console.log("Calculating...");
    const result = n + 10;
    cache[n] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

const add = memoizedAdd();
console.log(add(5)); // Calculating... 15
console.log(add(5)); // Returning from cache 15



Ques6. What is the data type of variables in JavaScript?

Ans: JavaScript variables can have any data type, and their data types can change dynamically.



Ques7. What are escape characters? Why are they used? Give code example.

Ans:
Escape characters allow you to use special characters inside strings (like quotes, newlines, tabs).

const message = "He said, \"Hello!\"";
const newline = "Line1\nLine2";



Ques8. What is break and continue statements? How are they different?

Ans: "break" is used to exit a loop prematurely, while "continue" is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one.



Ques9. What is the typeof an array in JavaScript?

Ans: The typeof operator returns "object".



Ques10. What are anonymous functions in JavaScript?

Ans: Anonymous functions are functions that are defined without a formal function name and can be used as expressions or assigned to variables.




Ques11. Give example of anonymous function

Ans:
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Hello from anonymous function");
}, 1000);



Ques12. What is the difference between the event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() methods in JavaScript?

Ans: event.preventDefault() prevents the default behavior of the event, while event.stopPropagation() stops the event from propogating to its parent elements.



Ques13. Here's the question converted into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options and the correct answer: What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?

Ans: Higher order functions are functions that operates on other functions by either taking them as arguments or returning them.



Ques14. Explain higher order functions with code example.

Ans:
function greet(name) {
  return function (message) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, ${message}`);
  };
}

const greetJohn = greet("John");
greetJohn("Welcome!"); // Hello John, Welcome!
