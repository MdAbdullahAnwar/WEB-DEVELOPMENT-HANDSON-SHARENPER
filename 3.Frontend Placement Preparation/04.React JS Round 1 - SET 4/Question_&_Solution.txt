Ques1. What is Reconciliation in React?

Ans:
Reconciliation is React's diffing algorithm that determines what parts of the DOM need to be updated when state or props change.

When a component's state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the real DOM).
It then compares (diffs) the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to find the minimal changes needed.
Finally, it updates only those parts in the real DOM (instead of re-rendering everything).
This makes React fast and efficient because it avoids unnecessary DOM manipulations.



Ques2. What are Fragments? How are they better than <div> elements?

Ans:
Fragments (<React.Fragment> or <>...<>) let you group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node.

Advantages over <div>:
No unnecessary DOM clutter (avoids "div soup").
Better performance (fewer nodes to render).
Useful when returning multiple adjacent elements (React components must return a single root element).


Example:

// Without Fragment (adds extra div)

return (

 <div>

  <h1>Title</h1>

  <p>Description</p>

 </div>

);



// With Fragment (no extra div)

return (

 <>

  <h1>Title</h1>

  <p>Description</p>

 </>

);



Ques3. What element gets introduced into the DOM when we use Fragments? How does it work?

Ans:
Fragments do not introduce any element into the DOM.
They act as invisible wrappers, allowing grouped elements to be rendered side by side without an extra parent node.
How it works:

When React renders <React.Fragment>, it skips creating a DOM node and just renders its children.
This keeps the DOM cleaner and more efficient.



Ques4. What are the Advantages of React Compared to Vanilla JS?

Ans:
React offers several advantages over vanilla JavaScript. It simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces by using a component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and modularity. React also provides a virtual DOM that optimizes rendering performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation. Additionally, it enables efficient state management and makes it easier to handle dynamic data updates. With a strong ecosystem, developer tools, and community support, React significantly enhances productivity and maintainability compared to writing everything manually in vanilla JavaScript.



Ques5. Why Does React Use className Instead of class?

Ans:
className is a reserved keyword in JavaScript (used for ES6 classes).
React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), so it follows JavaScript naming conventions.
className avoids conflicts and matches the DOM property name (element.className).

Example:

<div className="header">Hello</div>

<div class="header">Hello</div> (works but not recommended)



Ques6. What is the children Prop? When Should We Use It?

Ans:
The children prop is a special prop that lets you pass content between component tags.
When to use it:

When you want a wrapper component to render nested content.
For layout components (e.g., Modal, Card).


Example:

// Parent Component

const Card = ({ children }) => {

 return <div className="card">{children}</div>;

};


// Usage

<Card>

 <h2>Title</h2> {/* This becomes `children` */}

 <p>Content</p> {/* This also becomes `children` */}

</Card>



Output:

<div class="card">

 <h2>Title</h2>

 <p>Content</p>

</div>
