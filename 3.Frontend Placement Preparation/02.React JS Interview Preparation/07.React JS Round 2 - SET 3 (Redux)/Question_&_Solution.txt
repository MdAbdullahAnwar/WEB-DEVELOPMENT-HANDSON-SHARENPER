Ques1. What is Redux?

Ans:
Redux is a predictable state management library used mainly in JavaScript applications (especially with React) to manage global application state in a centralized store.



Ques2. Why do we need Redux? How is it better than Context API?

Ans:
Redux is needed when an app has complex state logic or shared state across many components.

Compared to Context API:

1. Redux offers better performance with large-scale apps (due to selective re-rendering).
2. It provides dev tools, middleware, and action history, which Context API lacks.
3. Redux is more structured and testable for big apps.



Ques3. What is Flux?

Ans:
Flux is a design pattern (by Facebook) for managing data flow in applications. Redux is inspired by Flux but simplifies it by having a single store and pure reducers.



Ques4. Core Principles of Redux:

Ans:
1. Single source of truth – Entire state is in one store.
2. State is read-only – State can only be changed by dispatching actions.
3. Changes are made with pure functions – Reducers specify how state updates happen.



Ques5. What are Pure Functions?

Ans:
A pure function:

1. Returns the same output for the same input.
2. Has no side effects (e.g., no API calls, no modifying external variables).
3. Reducers in Redux must be pure functions.



Ques6. Can Redux only be used with React?

Ans:
No. Redux is a JavaScript library that can be used with any frontend framework (e.g., Angular, Vue, vanilla JS)—not just React.



Ques7. How do you decide which state to put in a reducer vs local state?

Ans:
Use Redux (reducer) for:

1. Global/shared state (e.g., auth, user, cart, theme).
2. State needed in multiple components.
3. State that must persist or be debugged via Redux DevTools.


Use local state (useState) for:

- UI-only state
Form inputs, toggles, modals, dropdowns, tabs
Example: isOpen, inputValue, hoveredItem

- Ephemeral state
Data that doesn’t need to persist beyond the component’s lifecycle
Example: temporary filters, animation flags

- Performance-sensitive state
Avoid pushing trivial state into Redux to prevent unnecessary global re-renders

- Component-specific logic
State that only matters to one component and doesn’t affect others
Example: local pagination, step in a wizard, controlled input fields

- Prototyping or isolated features
When you’re experimenting or building a feature that may later move to Redux if it grows
