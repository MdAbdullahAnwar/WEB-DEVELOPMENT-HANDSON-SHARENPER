You can refer this resource . But answer everything in your own words. Dont copy paste!!

Also when i ask for example please dont copy the example in the resources? Make your own examples.

If you are found copying the examples or the answers you will have to repeat everything again



2 advices



1. Dont read any docs related to questions on react class based components. It would be a waste of time and trust me no one asks questions on it nowadays .

2. Understand the deeper concepts of everything you read. Definition will never do as the interviewer would always ask you deeper concepts.




Ques1. What is React? What are the advantages of using React , compared to normal Javascript?

Ans: 
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications, using a component-based architecture.

Advantages over normal JavaScript:
Component-Based Architecture: Reusable, modular UI blocks.
Virtual DOM: Efficient diffing and updating of DOM.
Declarative UI: You describe what you want, React handles how.
State Management: Better control over UI interactivity.



Ques2. What is difference between library and framework? Is React a library or a framework? Explain the reason?

Ans: 
Library: Gives you tools to use as needed & More flexible, less opinionated

Framework: Controls the flow, you fill in the blanks & More opinionated and structured

React is a library because:

You call React’s APIs (e.g., ReactDOM.render) — React does not call your code.
You have full control over architecture, routing, and state handling.



Ques3. What is useState() in React? What does usestate return? What does it take as argument? Give code example of usestate?

Ans:
useState() is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components.

It takes:
The initial value of the state.
It returns:
An array with 2 items: the current state and a function to update it.

Example:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {

 const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // 0 is initial value

 return (

  <div>

   <p>Count: {count}</p>

   <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>

  </div>

 );

}



Ques4. What are state variables in react ? How are they different from normal variables? How do we decide when to use states and when to use normal variables?

Ans:
i. State Variables: Managed by React with useState(), Cause re-render on change, Persist between renders

ii. Normal Variables: Just JS variables, Do not cause re-render, Lost after re-render



Use state when we want UI to re-render on value change (e.g., form input, toggle, count).

Use normal variables for temporary, internal computations.



Ques5. What are keys in React? When should we use it? what is the advantage of keys?

Ans:
Keys are unique identifiers for items in a list.

Use them:
When rendering a list of elements with .map().
Benefits:
Helps React identify which items changed, added, or removed.
Boosts rendering performance.


Example:

{items.map(item => (

 <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>

))}



Ques6.What is JSX? How does JSX work?

Ans:
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that looks like HTML inside JavaScript.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

Under the hood, JSX is converted to:

React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');



Ques7. What is DOM? What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?

Ans:
DOM: Document Object Model — a tree structure representing UI in browser.

Virtual DOM: A lightweight JavaScript copy of the real DOM used by React.


How React uses Virtual DOM:

1. When state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM.
2. Compares it with previous virtual DOM (diffing).
3. Only updates changed parts in real DOM (reconciliation).
4. Improves performance and efficiency.



Ques8.What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components? Design of controlled and unontrolled component and paste the code here?

Ans: 
i. Controlled Component: Form data is handled by React state, One source of truth (state) and Easier to validate and control 

Example:

function ControlledInput() {

 const [value, setValue] = useState("");

 return (

  <input 

   type="text" 

   value={value} 

   onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} 

  />

 );

}



ii. Uncontrolled Component: Form data handled by the DOM, Uses refs to access DOM and Less control, more native

Example:

import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledInput() {

 const inputRef = useRef();

 const handleSubmit = () => {

  alert(inputRef.current.value);

 };

 return (

  <>

   <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />

   <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>

  </>

 );

}
